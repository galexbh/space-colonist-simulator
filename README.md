# special-colonists-simulator

Currently, management games and simulators have proven to be a valuable tool for learning and exploring complex scenarios. However, most of these focus on familiar terrestrial environments and do not address the problems of colonization and resource management in an unexplored world. It is in this context that the "Horizon Settlers Simulator" project arose, a simulation tool designed to put users in the role of administrators of a human colony on a planet different from ours.
